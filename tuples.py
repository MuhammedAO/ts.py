# a tuple is a type of data structure which means that it's a container where we can store different values.

# a tuple is very similar to a list. its a structure where we can store multiple pieces of information

# one of the most common example of topple is coordinates.

coordinates = (4,6)

# one of the things that makes tuples unique is that they are immutable which means that they can't be changed or modified

# differebce between a tuple and a list?? 
# use tuples for data that you don't want to change
