from math import *

# Any python program you write would most likey be dealing with numbers at some point.

# print(4 * 5.7)

# bidmas => bracket, indices, division, multiplication, addition, substraction

print(4 * (5 - 2) + (2 / 50))

# modulus
print(10 % 8)

# number variable
my_num = -69
# py wouldn't allow this if it the num wasn't converted to a string
print(str(my_num) + " is my favorite number")

# a lot of times in python you're gonna be using more advanced math operators
# absolute value
print(abs(my_num))

# ^raise to power
print(pow(4, 4))

# max => returns the larger num, min => smaller
print(max(4, 5))

# round
print(round(3.14))

# there are other math functions i wanna show u but we'll need to import them from the math module
# This is the largest integer <= x.
print(floor(5.677))

# This is the smallest integer >= x.
print(ceil(5.677))

# Return the square root of x.
print(sqrt(16))
