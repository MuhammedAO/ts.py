# variables & data-types

# in python, you would be dealing with a lot of data that consists of various kinds of information and values
#a variable in a container for storing data-values... which makes it a lot easy for us to manage and work with all of the different data inside of our programs.

#imagine that i want to change the name muhammed to a different name... i'll have to manually go through each file to change the name when i could have just stored it in a variable.

#say for instance we also want to change the my job description. also imagine a story with a character whose name is mentioned a 100 times. you would have to manually change that too

#storing our data inside of a variable makes it a lot easier to make use of that data where-ever we might need it.

#when creating variables in py, you want to separate another word with an _

developer_name = "Muhammed"
job_description = "full-stack"
is_male = True
# print("Hello Guys")
# print("my name is Muhammed")
# print("and i am a full-crack developer")
# print("yes, full-crack")
# print("dont be like Muhammed")

# DT => Strings, Numbers, Boolean
# Boolean => True/False. there's going to be a lot of instances in our programs where we would want represent a true or false data
# # you can also modify variable values half-way

print("Hello Guys")
print("my name is " +  developer_name)
print("and i am a " + job_description + " developer")
print("yes, " + job_description)
print("dont be like " + developer_name)
